# Shiny Living Dex Tracker

This project consists on a table which allows tracking shiny Pokémon collections. The *Save data* button downloads a JSON file with all the data introduced in the table, and the *Load data* button loads the JSON files generated by the *Save data* button. 

In the future it is planned to:
- Migrate the project to React and revise the code to make the table load faster.
- Add an option to display the table in boxes of 30 Pokémon.
- Translate the project to English.
